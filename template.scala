        ---Section 1---
        Take in the dimensions for M1 (rows followed by columns)
        Create and populate ArrayBuffer with user input

        Print M1

        ---Section 2---
        Take in the dimensions for M2 (rows followed by columns)
        Create and populate ArrayBuffer with user input

        Print M2

        ---Section 3---
        Create a new ArrayBuffer that will hold the transpose
        of M2

        ---Section 4---
        Create a new ArrayBuffer that will hold the scalar 
        multiplication of m1 with the user specified multiplier

        ---Section 5---
        Create a new ArrayBuffer that will hold the addition of 
        M1 and M2. Matricies must be of equal size in order to add
